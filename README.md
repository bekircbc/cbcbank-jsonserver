# Bank Model

- Technologies : HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON Server

## Before Using

- Write on terminal

         json-server --watch db.json

- json-server works on port : 3000

- Accounts can be seen on (this link)[localhost:3000/accounts].

## JSON Server

- I use JSON-Server for taking Account data from Server.

- GET, PATCH or DELETE this data in JSON Server.

> > > [x] request kredit

> > > [x] transfer money

> > > [x] change pin

> > > [x] delete account
